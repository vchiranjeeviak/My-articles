## Web 1.0  VS  Web 2.0  VS  Web 3.0

## Introduction

- If we don't know about decentralised internet by the end of this decade, we have to struggle like some old or illiterate people struggling now to use internet.
- Web 3 is the decentralised internet.
- Before knowing web 3, we first need to know about web 1 and web 2.

This article is an attempt to give readers a sense of what web 3 is.


## Web 1.0

- Web 1.0 is the first iteration of web.
- The users could only see or read the data from the web applications.
- It wasn't possible to send data from user side to the server.
- The creators were mostly developers who build websites.
- The websites used to be static and hence, no interactivity.
- In simple words, websites were just newspapers but on computer screen in web 1.0 era.

## Web 2.0

- The web that most of us using extensively now-a-days is web 2.0 .
- In web 1.0, you need to be a developer to share data through internet as you have to code the web application by yourself.
- But in web 2.0, you are not coding anything to share data on internet.
- We are just using an application like facebook or whatsapp to share anything.
- Web 2.0 is web 1.0 with interactivity.
- Users can not only read the data but can also write data (send data to server).

### Disadvantages of web 2.0

- In web 2.0, the companies which built the applications for people to use has the centralised authority.
- That is why this is centralised internet.
- Companies have the access to the user data with which they can do whatever they want like advertising, recommendations.
- They are charging users for letting the people use their application like buying apps on app store or play store.
- Banks are also centralised and governments can also intervene in their decisions.
- These centralised organisations can shut down whenever they want.

All these are because of having a centralised power. In decentralised system, everyone in the network has equal power.

## Web 3.0

- Web 3.0 aims to solve the issues discussed above.
- Web 3.0 applications doesn't just run on a single server and use a single database.
- Instead, they run on a block chain.
- To know what is block chain and how it works, read this short and informative article written by me [a short article on block chain](https://vchiranjeeviak.hashnode.dev/what-is-block-chain)
- Applications which run on block chain are called decentralised applications (Dapps).
- Our data is safe in web 3.0. It is because that our identity in web 3.0 is a wallet address which is a long hash value rather than our actual details like name etc.
- Web 3.0 uses a peer to peer architecture.
