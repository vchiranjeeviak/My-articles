## Introduction

This article gives a brief idea about Ethereum, Ether, Addresses, Private keys and Wallets.

Now, let's get into this one.

## Ethereum

- **Ethereum** is a block chain like **Bitcoin** but with few differences. **Bitcoin** only supports the transfer of bitcoin cryptocurrency in the network.
- But **Ethereum** is a general purpose block chain. Developers can build applications on Ethereum block chain. These apps are called **Decentralised Applications** or **DApps** for short.
- Before Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin argued that block chain can have much wider impact than just currency exchange. This led to the development of a new block chain platform called **Ethereum** and a programming language called **Solidity** to build apps on top of it.
- These **DApps** by default inherit the security benefits from the Ethereum block chain.

### Etheruem Vs Ether

- A lot of beginners have a misconception that **Etheruem** is a cryptocurrency. But **Ethereum** actually is a block chain rather than a cryptocurrency.
- **Ether** or simply **Eth** is the cryptocurrency that is required to make any transactions on the network.

## Address

- An **address** is a string of letters and numbers that represents your account on the block chain.
- We can interact with the DApps, send or receive funds using this address.

### Private Key

- **A private key** is kind of a password that is a combination of bunch of letters and numbers.
- This **private key** allows us to manage the crypto held by the corresponding address.
- To let others interact with us on the network, we need to share our **address** and it is fine to share our address with anyone.
- But we shouldn't share our **private key** as it can't be changed later and can't be restored if we forget the password.

## Crypto Wallet

- A single individual can have multiple addresses on the block chain.
- A **crypto wallet** is a manager which manages all the **address** and **private keys** that belong to us.

### Seed Phrase

- A **seed phrase** is a collection of words which is considered as the password for the crypto wallet.


In simple terms, every **address** is an account on block chain. Like how an individual can have multiple accounts, they can have multiple **addresses**. Each **address** has a password which is the **private key** of the address. A **manager** which can manage **multiple addresses** is a **wallet**. And password for this **wallet** is called **seed phrase**.
